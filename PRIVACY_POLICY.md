# Privacy Policy - TechieExtensions

**Last Updated: December 2024**

## Overview

TechieExtensions (including Techie JSON Manager and Techie Mark Down Manager) are committed to protecting your privacy. Our browser extensions are designed with privacy-first principles, operating entirely offline without any data collection or tracking.

## Data Collection

**We do NOT collect any data whatsoever.**

Our extensions:
- ❌ Do NOT collect personal information
- ❌ Do NOT track your browsing activity
- ❌ Do NOT store usage analytics
- ❌ Do NOT send any data to external servers
- ❌ Do NOT use cookies or tracking pixels
- ❌ Do NOT require user accounts or registration
- ❌ Do NOT display advertisements

## How Our Extensions Work

### 100% Offline Processing
All functionality operates entirely within your browser:
- JSON parsing, validation, and beautification happens locally
- Markdown rendering and editing occurs on your device
- No internet connection required after installation
- Your files and data never leave your browser

### Local Storage
The extensions may use browser's local storage ONLY for:
- Saving your preferences (theme, font size, etc.)
- Temporarily storing content for the current editing session
- All stored data remains on your device
- You can clear this data at any time through your browser settings

## Permissions

Our extensions request minimal permissions necessary for functionality:

### Required Permissions:
- **Storage**: To save your preferences locally
- **Tabs**: To detect and work with JSON/Markdown files
- **ActiveTab**: To interact with the current tab when you activate the extension

### What We Can Access:
- Only the content of JSON/Markdown files you explicitly open
- Only when you actively use the extension

### What We Cannot Access:
- Your browsing history
- Your bookmarks
- Your passwords or personal information
- Other websites or tabs
- Files on your computer (unless you explicitly open them in the browser)

## Third-Party Services

Our extensions do NOT integrate with any third-party services:
- No Google Analytics
- No Facebook Pixel
- No advertising networks
- No crash reporting services
- No CDN or external resources

## Data Security

Since we don't collect any data, there's nothing to secure on our end. However:
- All processing happens in your browser's sandboxed environment
- We follow browser security best practices
- Our code is open source and auditable

## Children's Privacy
